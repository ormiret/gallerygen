* Check if shrunk version exists before making it
Currently makes the shrunk version every time even if it's already there. This is a bit of a wast of cycles. 
Should probably have some checking of age as well as existence to regen is original is younger than shrunk version. 
* Support for different ratio images in a row
I'd like to mix wide and tall images in a row and have them match height and have the widths figured out appropriately. Needs a quite different approach to current one to do that.
