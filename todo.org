* Check if shrunk version exists before making it
Currently makes the shrunk version every time even if it's already there. This is a bit of a waste of cycles. 
Should probably have some checking of age as well as existence to regen is original is younger than shrunk version. 
* Autoscrolling
I'd like to add autoscrolling of the gallery so it can be put on a screen and left running. Would have rows moved to the end after they are scrolled off the top of the screen so that it will scroll infinitely (I expect if I do that naively it will screw up the scroll position as everything else jumps up but I'm sure I can find some reference stuff for infinite scrolling and then make that autoscrolling).
* Zoom out
I quite like the "zoomed out" version you get when window is a lot taller than it is wide, could get the same effect by setting quite large margins. Could add something to toggle that.
