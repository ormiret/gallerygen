* Check if shrunk version exists before making it
Currently makes the shrunk version every time even if it's already there. This is a bit of a wast of cycles. 
Should probably have some checking of age as well as existence to regen is original is younger than shrunk version. 
* Tidy up the generated page
Could do with a bit of padding for body?
Shouldn't have lines in there from the links.
Could do with actually lining up edges. 
Might need to find someone who actually knows what they're doing with web design to take a look at it...
* Support for different ratio images in a row
I'd like to mix wide and tall images in a row and have them match height and have the widths figured out appropriately. Needs a quite different approach to current one to do that.
